# Home Assistant Integration for GARDENA smart local API (preview)

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

Home Assistant integration for GARDENA smart devices using local communication (not going through the cloud).

## Features

- Local communication with GARDENA smart devices
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

## Enabling WebSocket Support on the Gateway

The still experimental WebSocket service running on the gateway is disabled by default.
You can enable it through the gateway's web interface by visiting e.g.: https://GARDENA-123456.local

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the IP address found under "Garden Profile" in the GARDENA smart system app.

> [!NOTE]
> The password is the first block of the gateway ID printed on the back of the device, e.g.:
>
> ID: `1234abcd-996c-48f7-83dc-d2d1bac08e7e` → password: `1234abcd`

The advanced options are hidden behind a tiny grey arrow at the bottom of the page.

Alternatively, you can enable WebSocket support using e.g. `curl`:
```txt
gateway=GARDENA-123456.local
password=1234abcd

session=$(curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"password": "'"$password"'"}' --insecure https://$gateway/login | jq -r .session)

curl -X PUT -H "X-session: $session" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"enable": true}' --insecure https://$gateway/websocket_api
```

The service `websocketd` is now listening on port 8443/TCP.

To disable WebSocket Support, you can run:
```txt
curl -X PUT -H "X-session: $session" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"enable": false}' --insecure https://$gateway/websocket_api
```

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. [Install HACS] on your Home Assistant instance
2. Click on HACS in the sidebar
3. Search for "GARDENA smart local (preview)" and install the integration
4. Restart Home Assistant

[Install HACS]: https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/gardena_smart_local_preview` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

After installation, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for "GARDENA smart local". Enter the IP address or hostname of your gateway and the password.

The gateway can also be discovered automatically via Zeroconf — look for a notification in Home Assistant after installation.

### YAML configuration (legacy)

Manual YAML configuration is still supported:

```yaml
gardena_smart_local_preview:
  host: 192.168.1.100  # IP address or hostname of your GARDENA smart Gateway
  password: 0824b95b   # First eight characters of the gateway's ID
```

After adding the configuration, restart Home Assistant.

## Blueprints

### Open Valve (with duration)

The `open_valve` action lets you override a valve's configured duration per
call, but Home Assistant has no built-in dashboard card that prompts for a
service field on tap. This blueprint wraps `open_valve` in a script, whose
more-info dialog does render the `duration` field as a form — so you can pick
a one-off duration from the dashboard without writing a custom card.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcloudless-garden%2Fha-gardena-smart-local-preview%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fscript%2Fgardena_smart_local_preview%2Fopen_valve_with_duration.yaml)

After importing, create a script from the blueprint and pick the valve.

#### Showing the valve's real state on the card

The script's own state always reads "off" — it finishes running the instant
the open command is acknowledged, while the valve itself keeps running for
the requested duration on the gateway's own timer, independently of the
script. So a card built directly around the script entity won't reflect
whether water is actually flowing.

Point a tile card at the **valve entity** for its state, tap to open the
script's duration form, and add a `valve-open-close` tile feature for a
direct, native stop control:

```yaml
type: tile
entity: valve.your_valve_entity_id # the valve
tap_action:
  action: more-info
  entity: script.your_open_valve_script # the script created from this blueprint
icon_tap_action:
  action: more-info
  entity: script.your_open_valve_script # same as tap_action, above
features_position: bottom
features:
  - type: valve-open-close
```

Replace `valve.your_valve_entity_id` and `script.your_open_valve_script` with
your actual entity IDs — the script's entity ID depends on the name you gave
it when creating it from the blueprint.

Tapping the tile opens the script's own more-info dialog, which renders the
Duration field as a form and runs the script on confirm — no custom
open/close service calls needed. The `valve-open-close` feature adds real
Open/Close buttons for the valve entity directly on the card face.

### Power On (with duration)

Same idea as the valve blueprint, for the `enable_output` action: it wraps the
service in a script so its more-info dialog renders the `duration` field as
a form, letting you pick a one-off on-time from the dashboard.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcloudless-garden%2Fha-gardena-smart-local-preview%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fscript%2Fgardena_smart_local_preview%2Fenable_output_with_duration.yaml)

After importing, create a script from the blueprint and pick the power
outlet.

The same caveat as the valve applies: the script's own state always reads
"off" the instant the command is acknowledged, not while the outlet is
actually on. Point a tile card at the **outlet's switch entity** instead
(it tracks the real on/off state, same as the valve entity), with `tap_action`
set to open the script's more-info dialog for the duration form. Unlike the
valve, no extra tile feature is used here: a plain tile pointed at the
switch entity already lets you tap the icon to toggle it directly via
`icon_tap_action`. The valve section's `valve-open-close` feature above is
just an optional convenience for visible Open/Close buttons; switches don't
need an equivalent since on/off is already the whole story:

```yaml
type: tile
entity: switch.gardena_smart_power_adapter_xxxxxxxx # change to your power outlet
tap_action:
  action: more-info
  entity: script.enable_output_of_gardena_smart_power_adapter_with_duration # change if necessary
icon_tap_action:
  action: toggle
```

## Removal

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Find the "GARDENA smart local (preview)" integration and click on it to see its entries (gateways)
3. On the gateway integration entry, click the three-dot menu and select **Delete**

If installed via HACS, you can also remove the integration files there: open HACS, find "GARDENA smart local (preview)", click on the three dots on the right and then on **Remove**. For a manual installation, delete the `custom_components/gardena_smart_local_preview` directory instead.

> [!NOTE]
> The temperature sensor integrated into Water Control devices is intended solely for frost detection, not for precise real-time temperature tracking.

> [!WARNING]
> Installing a firmware update on a Gen1 device factory-resets its settings. Schedules and other configuration will be lost and need to be set up again afterwards. This does not affect Gen2 devices. The official GARDENA app writes the settings back to the device automatically after installing the update there, this integration does not, installing the update via the app avoids the loss.
